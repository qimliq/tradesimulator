Trade Simulator Project
-----------------------
This project has been created in Python to backtest a few different trading algorithms on test data. 

It's implemented both for exercising Python language and also various features of open source TALib Library.

The project code consists of various bits and pieces and it's not implemented as a standalone executable. So you need 
to spend some time to customise to your needs.

Project contains:
- Metastock to CSV file convertor
- Pandas library calls for CSV reading
- TALib library calls for various Technical Analysis indicators usage
- An imaginary portfolio and capital level to start a backtest.
- matplotlib library calls for drawing some charts

Feel free to add more algorithms and stocks data to perform new backtests.
